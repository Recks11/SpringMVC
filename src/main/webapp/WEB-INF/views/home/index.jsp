                          <li>  We shall encourage Government, Private Sector and Civil Society partnership in our administration as we believe that this will help to improve the socio, political, cultural and economic activities of our communities.</li>
                          <li>  We shall institute a regular quarterly Town Hall Meetings between Stakeholders in the community and our Executive Council to engage in regular téte-à-tête on issues relating to the development of our communities.</li>
                          <li>  Our administration shall establish an I.C.T training and business centre for skills and vocational training.</li>
                          <li>  Our administration shall reinforce the skill acquisition center at Abule Ado to train people in vocational skills and production of materials in some of our social establishments i.e. Furniture for our primary schools, offices et al.</li>

                          <li>  A musical studio shall be established for talent development.</li>
                          <li>  Youth empowerment and job creation shall be our primary assignment.</li>
                          <li>  Social and Cultural development such as support for social programmes i.e. Talk show, Workshops, Carnivals and other social activities will be strongly encouraged.</li>
                          <li>  Open door policy will be our watch word.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We will achieve most of these projects through networking with stakeholders in the community , some will be outsourced while collaborating with likely partners such as the NGO’s and donor agencies like UNICEF, USAID, ACTION AID , formal and informal sectors ,and several other bodies both in and outside of Nigeria.</p>
                      <p>Our immediate attention will go to road rehabilitation, primary school education development, opening of the drainages, security, street lightings and environmental development in the first 100 days of our administration.</p>
                      <p>We believe that it takes a lot of vision to fulfill our outlined agenda, but our confidence lies not in our own abilities but by the grace of the Almighty God.</p>
                      <p>The Website is an initiative that affords the residents of the Local Government and Nigeria in general to interact with the administration, access information on government policy and programs, and ensuring that government business is done on real time. The website is also expected to serve as a liaison forum for intending visitors who will no longer need to get to the L.G secretariat before they can get information.</p>
                      <p>The 21st Century realities are clearly requiring that the instrumentality of the technology be put into utmost use to maximize potentials and improve productivity.This philosophy is what informs our building of this interactive platform to afford the people the opportunity to participate in the process that should lead to the realization of this administration’s 20 points agenda.</p>
