                <h1>History of a Amuwo Odofin Local Government</h1>
                <p>
                    The indigenous dwellers of Amuwo Local Government are mainly the Aworis. Nonetheless, considering its location as a near border Local Government,
                    International trade has found its root in the area with people of various extractions engaging in various forms of trading activities.</p>

                <p>it must also be stated that the hospitality of the people has also attracted people from other ethnic tribes
                    in Nigeria as well as from neighbouring West African States to the area.</p>

                <p>Another noticeable group is the retired and serving Civil Servants,
                    industrialists and members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria who have taken advantages of the
                    serene atmosphere of the Estates located in the Local Government to reside in the area.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section3" class="scrosection">
                <h1>Culture and Tradition</h1>
                <p>The culture and tradition of Amuwo cannot be separated from those of the indigenous dwellers of the Aworis.
                    Some of the festivals embraced by the people are Elegba, Oro, Sangbeto and Igunuko festivals.</p>

                <p>The culture reflects an affinity with the Badagry people,
                    since the council area is located within the same State delineated geo-political zone as them.</p>

                <p>The custodians of culture and tradition in the area are the traditional rulers.
                    The Local Government is blessed with highly reputable Obas and Chiefs and Baales.
                    This includes Oba Mobadenle Obalade Oyekan- the Onilado of Ilado/Inagbe Islands and Oba Lateef Olayinka Ado,
                    Fabuwa 1, Alado of Ado Land. </p>

                <h1>Commerce and Industry</h1>
                <p> The Local Government boasts of enterprising people. However,
                    it should be noted that the indigenous are agrarian and engage mostly in fishing and production of crops such as cassava,
                    maize, coconuts and cashew nuts.</p>

                <p>Some parts of the Local Government are zoned as industrial estates by the Lagos State Government.
                    The Local Government is making attempts to construct shopping complexes in collaboration with private entrepreneurs.</p>

                <p> Commercial activities are well grounded in the Local Government area.
                    This is made possible by such factors as adequate security, good roads-network,
                    ready market and a generally conducive atmosphere which is prevalent in the area.</p>
